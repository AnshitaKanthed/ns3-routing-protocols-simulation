# Performance evaluation of AODV, DSDV and DSR protocol

## Introduction
This project is a simulation of AODV, DSDV and DSR routing protocols in a wireless network. The simulation is done using NS-3.40. The performance of the protocols is evaluated based on the following metrics:
- Packet Delivery Fraction
- Throughput
- End-to-End Delay
- Jitter
- Packet Loss
